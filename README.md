## Concept
This project is a code quiz. The user is presented with 20 questions and has 2 minutes to answer as many questions as they can. Each wrong answer will deduct from the timer. At the end of the quiz the user is given their final score and may enter their name. Once they do they are redirected to the Leader Board page. The scores and name are stored in local storage so the information will persist even after closing or refreshing the page.
